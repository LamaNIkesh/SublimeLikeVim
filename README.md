Minimalistic .vimrc file for setting up your vim editor with sublime like look.

## Installation

I used Vundle to manage packages to make it easier. So, I suggest you install Vundle.
You can install it easily using the following commands:

```Execute the git clone and place it into ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Add the file to your user's home directory

touch ~/.vimrc

```
