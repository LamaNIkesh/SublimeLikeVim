## SublimeLikeVim
<a name="usage-linting"></a>
Minimalistic .vimrc file for setting up your vim editor with sublime like look.It also has powerline, numbering, syntax check and molokai theme. 

## Installation

I used Vundle to manage packages to make it easier. So, I suggest you install Vundle.
You can install it easily using the following commands:

```Execute the git clone and place it into ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
Add the file to your user's home directory
touch ~/.vimrc
```
Simply copy contents of .vimrc into your .vimrc file. You should have a .vimrc file in your home directory. 
```
Run ls -all to see all the files in current directory. 
```
